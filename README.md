This project is made using python flask (duh!).

PS, this was my first Full stack project, was building this with 0 development experience, so in no way is it polished, secure or optimized! :)
The code is very messy and full of "WTF? Why is this like this parts!?" and there are literally no authentications or error handling approaches.
And I am too lazy to fix and improve the code now LOL!
However for a 1st time, I don't think this is that bad and it actually gets the job done quite well, which is a win for me !!
So kindly do not judge me based on this project, I promise I have improved a lot from here! 😁👍
Its messy yes, but it works, feel free to explore the code and see how bad i was at the beginnning 🫠
