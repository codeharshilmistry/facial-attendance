# facial-attendance
This project is made using python flask.
Instead of having to manually mark attendance of students, this system marks the attendance automatically using face recognition.

This system uses Python and Flask concepts such as jsonify, Session, base64, OpenCV, face_recognition, uuid, numpy, pandas, ast, datetime.

PS, this was my first Full stack project, was building this with 0 development experience, so in no way is it polished, secure or optimized!😭😭
There are literally no authentications or error handling approaches.
And I am too lazy to fix and improve the code and website LOL
So kindly do not judge me based on this project, I am beter than this! 😁👍
